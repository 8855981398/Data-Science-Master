    "Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) is used for discrete random variables. It gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a specific value. The PMF is defined as:\n",
    "PMF(x) = P(X = x)\n",

    "Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "The Probability Density Function (PDF) is used for continuous random variables. Unlike discrete random variables, continuous random variables can take on any value within a certain range.

    "PDF(170 cm) = 0.03 (hypothetical value)\n",

    "The PDF value indicates that the density of the height being exactly 170 cm is 0.03, but the actual probability of an individual having exactly 170 cm height is infinitesimally small since the height is a continuous variable.\n",
